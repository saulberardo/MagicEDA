There are currently three packages available. The packages `univar` and `bivar` have functions for plotting one and two variables, respectively. The package `geo` has functions for calculating distances and plotting maps. The functions included are able of executing the following:

* Plotting a "data frame profile", which consists in a figure having one subplot for each variable in the dataset. Each subplot shows the variable distribution (histograms for numeric variables and bar charts for categorical).
* Plotting scatter plots with a tip box that is shown when points are hovered.
* Function to add an additional x axis bellow a figure.
* Function to compute the distance between a point and a segment (composed by two points).
* Function to plot a path (composed by a list o coordinates) over a map (the function automattically chooses a viewpoint to show the path (optionally with a padding).
